Since there is no binary to be found, we decide to
use gdb to explore the getflag binary

-> gdb /bin/getflag

First, we set a breakpoint at the beginning of the main function:

-> b *0x08048946

We now run the program. We can see that we are stopped because the program
has detected we are debugging it. Could we force the execution to go to a
given point ? We can indeed with the commad ju (it blindly jumps to an instruction).

In the code, we see a strange serie of cmp. We try one:

-> ju *0x8048b68

The program crashes, but, just before, it prints something: fiumuikeil55xe9cu4dood66h
Eh, that's the flag from level07 !

-> ju *0x8048ccb

wiok45aaoguiboiki2tuin6ub ... The flag of level06.

After some research, we finally find the flag we need:

-> ju *0x0804894a

And we have our final flag:

-> ju *0x8048de5

-> 7QiHafiNa3HVozsaXkawuYrTstxbpABHD8CPnHJ

-> su flag14
-> 7QiHafiNa3HVozsaXkawuYrTstxbpABHD8CPnHJ
-> Congratulation. Type getflag to get the key and send it to me the owner of this livecd :)
