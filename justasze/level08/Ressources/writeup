Once again, there is a binary executed with the rights we want.
There is also a file named token, on which we have, of course, no rights.
A quick look at the level08 binary objdump teaches us that it needs an argument,
which it will open and read. Of course, there is a catch, your argument, thus the
file you want to read, must not contain the substring "token" (strstr is called).

Once again, we can use tmp.

-> cd /tmp
-> ln -s /home/user/level08/token ./exploit
-> /home/user/level08/level08 exploit
-> su flag08
-> quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean
-> getflag

We can now get the next flag.
