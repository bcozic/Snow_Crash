Here, we have a binary that executes, once again, as flag07.
We disassemble it in gdb, and we can see the main function is
quite short. It will use the system function to cat an environment
variable. After some tests, we can see that the said variable is
LOGNAME. The, we just have to modify it to exectute some code.
We can now get our flag directly:

-> export LOGNAME=\`getflag\`
-> ./level07

We can now get the next flag.
