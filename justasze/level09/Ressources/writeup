Once again, we have a binary and a token.

By playing with the binary, we can see its logic is simple:
It takes a string as a parameter, and runs through it, adding to
each character its position in the string. Thus, "aaa" becomes "abc".

We guess the token file countains much probably the application of the binary to
the string we need. Thus, we hexdump it and get:

-> \x66\x34\x6b\x6d\x6d\x36\x70\x7c\x3d\x82\x7f\x70\x82\x6e\x83\x82\x44\x42\x83\x44\x75\x7b\x7f\x8c\x89

Then, with a little program in c, we can get the original string back:

-> f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq

-> su flag09
-> f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq

It works.

We can now get the next flag.
