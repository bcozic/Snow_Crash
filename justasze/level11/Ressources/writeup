Here, we have a lua script which tries to create a mini server on localhost
port 5151, and will wait for a connection.

However, upon execution, the assert fails, because the socket is already in use
(the script is already running). Thus, we connect to it via netcat

-> nc 127.0.0.1 5151

Here, we have a prompt asking for a password. When typing, the texxt appear in clear,
stange. We then try to inject a command.

-> $(getflag > /tmp/flag)

It works.

We can now get the next flag.
