We can see a perl script which seems to be running on localhost port 4747.
The script uses echo to print a x variable, which is an argument.

Thus, with curl, we can use access it, an get the flag by injecting the
getflag comand as the script's argument.

-> curl localhost:4747?x=\`getflag\`

We can now get the next flag.
