Here, we see a binary that asks us to exploit it. Ok.
Objdump or gdb aren't even needed (?!). A simple cat on it shows
it calls /usr/bin/env echo to display the "Exploit me" string.

Thus, if we modify our path, we can make it excecute our code with
flag03's permissions. We can't write anything in our home, but we can in tmp.
Thus, we write a little program in c (Ressources/exploit.c), and then change our
$PATH to include tmp in first position. We then compile the exploit, name it echo,
run level03 and... tadaaah ! We are flag03.

$>chmod 700 /home/user/level03
$>setfacl -d -m u::rwx /home/user/level03

$>gcc exploit.c -o /tmp/echo
$>export PATH=/tmp
$>./level03

flag03$> /bin/getflag

Now, we can get the next flag.
