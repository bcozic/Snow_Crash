First, we search for files belonging to flag00

$> find / -user flag00 2> /dev/null

Two are found:

/usr/sbin/john
/rofs/usr/sbin/john

The name is misleading, john is of no use here.
Let's go to dcode.fr the first "cracking" tool found here is the caesar code.

$> cat /usr/sbin/john

-> cdiiddwpgswtgt

When run, we find something in rot15:
-> nottoohardhere

We can now get the next flag.
